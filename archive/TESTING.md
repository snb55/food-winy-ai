## Test 1: Review Entry Modal Flow ‚≠ê START HERE

**Goal**: Verify the AI-powered entry creation with review-before-save pattern works correctly.

### Test Steps:

1. **Open the app**: https://food-winy-ai.web.app

2. **Sign in** with Google or email/password

3. **Click the "New Entry" button** (usually a "+" or "Add" button in the feed)

‚úÖ Modal closes automatically
‚úÖ Entry appears in the feed
‚úÖ Entry shows your edited title: "My Healthy Dinner"
‚úÖ Entry shows edited calories: 550 kcal
‚úÖ Other values remain as AI-generated

### Browser Console Check:

Open browser console (F12) and look for:
```
Creating entry with data: {...}
Entry created successfully: {...}
Created entry fieldValues: { name: "My Healthy Dinner", protein: 42, ... }
```

---

## Test 2: Entry Without Photo

**Goal**: Verify text-only entries work.

### Test Steps:

1. **Click "New Entry"**

2. **Enter description only** (no photo):
   ```
   Two scrambled eggs with whole wheat toast and avocado
   ```

3. **Click "Continue"**

4. **Review AI-generated data**:
   - Title: ~"Scrambled Eggs and Toast"
   - Protein: ~15-20g
   - Carbs: ~25-35g
   - Fat: ~15-25g
   - Calories: ~300-400

5. **Save without editing**

### Expected Results:

‚úÖ Entry creates successfully without photo
‚úÖ AI still generates accurate macro estimates
‚úÖ Entry appears in feed without photo

---

## Test 3: Entry With Photo Only

**Goal**: Verify photo-only entries work.

### Test Steps:

1. **Click "New Entry"**

2. **Add a photo only** (leave description empty or add minimal text like "lunch")

3. **Click "Continue"**

4. **Review AI-generated data**

### Expected Results:

‚úÖ AI analyzes the photo and generates:
- Title based on visual content
- Macro estimates from image recognition
- Summary describing what's visible in the photo

‚úÖ Photo appears in ReviewEntryModal
‚úÖ Entry saves successfully

---

## Test 4: Cancel During Review

**Goal**: Verify cancellation works without data loss.

### Test Steps:

1. **Create a new entry**

2. **Let AI analyze**

3. **Click "Cancel" in ReviewEntryModal**

### Expected Results:

‚úÖ Modal closes
‚úÖ Returns to AddEntryModal (should still have your description/photo)
‚úÖ No entry created in Firestore
‚úÖ Can try again or close completely

---

## Test 5: Basic Notion Sync (Legacy Mode)

**Goal**: Test Notion integration with default columns.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: This tests basic sync only. Full schema-based sync with macros requires template selection UI (not built yet).

### Setup:

1. **Create Notion Integration**:
   - Go to https://www.notion.so/my-integrations
   - Click "+ New integration"
   - Name: "Winy AI Test"
   - Copy the "Internal Integration Token"

2. **Create a Simple Notion Database**:
   - Open Notion
   - Create a new database (table view)
   - Add these columns:
     - **Name** (Title) - should already exist
     - **Date** (Date)
     - **Summary** (Text)
     - **Photo** (URL)
   - Click "..." menu ‚Üí "Add connections" ‚Üí Select "Winy AI Test"
   - Copy database ID from URL: `https://notion.so/xxx?v=yyy` ‚Üí copy `xxx`

### In the App:

3. **Go to Settings page**

4. **Notion Integration section**:
   - Paste your Notion API key (integration token)
   - Paste your database ID
   - Click "Verify Connection"

### Expected Results:

‚úÖ "Connection verified" message appears
‚úÖ Settings save successfully

### Create and Sync an Entry:

5. **Create a new entry** (follow Test 1 steps)

6. **Save the entry**

7. **Check browser console** for:
   ```
   Syncing entry to Notion via Cloud Function...
   Loaded schema for Notion sync: null (or undefined)
   Notion sync result: { pageId: "..." }
   ```

8. **Open your Notion database**

### Expected Results in Notion:

‚úÖ **New row appears** with:
- **Name**: The entry title (e.g., "Grilled Chicken Bowl")
- **Date**: Today's date
- **Summary**: The AI-generated summary
- **Photo**: Link to the uploaded photo (if any)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Expected Limitation**:
- ‚ùå Protein, Carbs, Fat, Calories do NOT appear (columns don't exist)
- This is because:
  1. We're using legacy sync mode
  2. Template selection UI isn't built yet
  3. Schema isn't passed to Cloud Function

---

## Test 6: Verify Cloud Functions Are Deployed

**Goal**: Ensure all Cloud Functions are accessible.

### Check Firebase Console:

1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Select your project (food-winy-ai)
3. Go to "Functions" in left sidebar
4. Verify these 6 functions exist:
   - ‚úÖ notionSearchDatabases
   - ‚úÖ notionCreatePage
   - ‚úÖ notionCreateDatabase
   - ‚úÖ notionVerifyConnection
   - ‚úÖ notionAnalyzeDatabase (NEW)
   - ‚úÖ notionSyncEntry (NEW)

### Alternative: Browser Console Test

Open browser console and run:

```javascript
// Test notionAnalyzeDatabase
const functions = firebase.functions();
const analyze = functions.httpsCallable('notionAnalyzeDatabase');

// Replace with your real API key and database ID
analyze({
  notionApiKey: 'your-api-key',
  databaseId: 'your-database-id'
}).then(result => console.log('Database analysis:', result.data));
```

### Expected Result:

```javascript
{
  databaseId: "xxx",
  title: "Your Database Name",
  columns: [
    { name: "Name", type: "title", id: "..." },
    { name: "Date", type: "date", id: "..." },
    { name: "Summary", type: "rich_text", id: "..." },
    // ... other columns
  ]
}
```

## Test 7: Entry Feed Display

**Goal**: Verify entries display correctly in the feed.

### Test Steps:

1. **Create 3-5 entries** with different foods

2. **View the feed page**

### Expected Results:

‚úÖ Entries appear in reverse chronological order (newest first)
‚úÖ Each entry card shows:
- Title
- Date/timestamp
- Summary
- Photo (if uploaded)
- Macro values (if displayed in EntryCard component)

‚úÖ Smooth scrolling
‚úÖ Apple-inspired minimalist design

---

## Test 8: Error Handling

**Goal**: Test error cases and validation.

### Test Case 1: Empty Entry

1. **Click "New Entry"**
2. **Click "Continue" without entering anything**

**Expected**: ‚ùå Error message: "Please add some text or a photo"

### Test Case 2: Invalid Notion Credentials

1. **Go to Settings**
2. **Enter fake Notion API key**: "secret_fake123"
3. **Enter fake database ID**: "123abc"
4. **Click "Verify Connection"**

**Expected**: ‚ùå Error message about invalid credentials

### Test Case 3: Network Error

1. **Disconnect from internet**
2. **Try to create an entry**

**Expected**: ‚ùå Error about network failure or AI analysis timeout

---

## Test 9: Photo Upload

**Goal**: Test photo handling edge cases.

### Test Case 1: Large Photo

- Upload a high-resolution photo (5MB+)
- **Expected**: ‚úÖ Upload works, may take longer

### Test Case 2: Remove Photo

1. Add a photo
2. Click "√ó" to remove it
3. **Expected**: ‚úÖ Photo preview disappears, can add new photo

### Test Case 3: Replace Photo

1. Add a photo
2. Remove it
3. Add a different photo
4. **Expected**: ‚úÖ New photo appears

---

## Test 10: Settings Page

**Goal**: Verify settings functionality.

### Test Steps:

1. **Navigate to Settings page**

2. **Check sections**:
   - ‚úÖ User info displayed (email)
   - ‚úÖ Notion Integration section visible
   - ‚úÖ Input fields for API key and database ID
   - ‚úÖ "Verify Connection" button
   - ‚úÖ "Create New Database" option (if implemented)

3. **Update Notion credentials**

4. **Verify they persist** (refresh page)

**Expected**: ‚úÖ Settings save and persist across page reloads

---

## Known Limitations (To Be Built)

### ‚ùå Missing Features:

1. **Template Selection UI**
   - Can't choose Macro Tracking, Simple Logging, or Keto Tracking
   - System doesn't know which fields to track
   - Creates default columns only

2. **Schema-Based Sync**
   - Entries don't sync with Protein, Carbs, Fat, Calories to Notion
   - Only syncs Name, Date, Summary, Photo (legacy mode)
   - Need template selection to work

3. **Column Matching**
   - Can't detect existing database columns
   - Can't map "When" ‚Üí "Date" or "Meal Name" ‚Üí "Name"
   - Sync fails if column names don't match exactly

4. **Column Mapping Storage**
   - No way to save custom column mappings
   - No UI to review/adjust auto-matched columns
