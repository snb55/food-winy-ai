# Deployment Guide - Database Configuration Feature

## üöÄ Steps to Deploy

This guide will help you deploy the new dynamic database configuration feature.

---

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Node.js 18+ installed
- [ ] Firebase CLI installed (`npm install -g firebase-tools`)
- [ ] Logged into Firebase (`firebase login`)
- [ ] Project selected (`firebase use your-project-id`)

---

## Step 1: Deploy Firestore Rules & Indexes

The new `schemas` collection needs security rules and indexes.

```bash
cd /Users/seanx/code/winy.ai/food\ app/food-winy-ai

# Deploy security rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

# Deploy indexes
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
```

**Expected output:**
```
‚úî Deploy complete!
‚úî firestore: rules deployed successfully
‚úî firestore: indexes deployed successfully
```

**What this does:**
- Adds security rules for the `schemas` collection
- Creates composite index for efficient schema queries (userId + updatedAt)

---

## Step 2: Deploy Firebase Functions

The Cloud Functions have been updated to support dynamic schemas.

```bash
# Make sure you're in the root directory
cd /Users/seanx/code/winy.ai/food\ app/food-winy-ai

# Deploy functions
firebase deploy --only functions
```

**Functions being deployed:**
- `notionSearchDatabases` (unchanged)
- `notionCreateDatabase` (‚ú® UPDATED - now supports dynamic schemas)
- `notionSyncEntry` (‚ú® UPDATED - now supports dynamic field values)
- `notionVerifyConnection` (unchanged)

**Expected output:**
```
‚úî functions[notionCreateDatabase]: Successful update operation
‚úî functions[notionSyncEntry]: Successful update operation
```

‚è±Ô∏è **Note:** This may take 2-3 minutes.

---

## Step 3: Build and Deploy Frontend

Build the React app with all the new components and deploy to Firebase Hosting.

```bash
# Build the app
npm run build

# Deploy to hosting
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

**Expected output:**
```
‚úî hosting: build folder uploaded successfully
‚úî Deploy complete!
```

**New files being deployed:**
- `SchemaSelector` component
- `DynamicEntryForm` component
- Updated `AddEntryModal`, `EntryCard`, `NotionOnboarding`, `Settings`
- Schema templates configuration
- Updated types and services

---

## Step 4: Verify Deployment

### 4.1 Check Firebase Console

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **Firestore Database**
4. Verify `schemas` collection rules are visible under "Rules" tab
5. Check "Indexes" tab - should see new `schemas` composite index

### 4.2 Check Cloud Functions

1. In Firebase Console, go to **Functions**
2. Verify all 4 functions show status: ‚úÖ Healthy
3. Check logs for any errors:
   ```bash
   firebase functions:log
   ```

### 4.3 Test the Live App

1. Go to your deployed app URL (e.g., `https://food-winy-ai.web.app` or `food.winy.ai`)
2. Log in or create a new account
3. Go to **Settings**
4. Click **"Set Up Notion Integration"**

**Expected Flow:**
- ‚úÖ See intro screen
- ‚úÖ Click "Get Started" ‚Üí Schema selection screen appears
- ‚úÖ See 4 template cards (Simple, Macro, Full Nutrition, Minimal)
- ‚úÖ Select "Macro Tracking"
- ‚úÖ See "Creating schema..." loading message
- ‚úÖ Redirected to API key entry screen
- ‚úÖ Continue with normal Notion setup

5. **Create a Test Entry:**
- Click "+" button
- Should see dynamic form with: Name, Photo, Meal Type, Protein, Carbs, Fat, Calories
- Fill in some values
- Submit
- Entry should sync to Notion with all fields visible

6. **Check Entry Display:**
- Entry card should show dynamic fields (e.g., "Protein: 35 g", "Carbs: 10 g")
- Schema badge should appear in footer
- Photo and AI summary should display

---

## Step 5: Monitor for Issues

### Check Firestore

```bash
# Open Firestore in browser
firebase open firestore
```

Look for:
- `schemas` collection should start appearing
- New entries should have `schemaId` and `fieldValues` fields
- `settings` docs should have `activeSchemaId` field

### Check Function Logs

```bash
# Stream live logs
firebase functions:log --only notionCreateDatabase,notionSyncEntry

# Look for:
# ‚úÖ "Building database with schema: Macro Tracking"
# ‚úÖ "Syncing entry with schema: Macro Tracking"
# ‚ùå Any errors or exceptions
```

### Check Browser Console

Open DevTools (F12) and look for:
- ‚úÖ "Creating schema..." log
- ‚úÖ "Schema created: [id]"
- ‚úÖ "Syncing entry to Notion via Cloud Function..."
- ‚ùå Any red errors

---

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If something goes wrong:

### Rollback Functions Only
```bash
# List previous deployments
firebase functions:log

# Rollback to specific version (if needed, contact Firebase support)
# Or redeploy previous version from git
```

### Rollback Frontend Only
```bash
git checkout [previous-commit]
npm run build
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

### Rollback Everything
```bash
git checkout [previous-commit]
npm run build
firebase deploy
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Schema not found" error in logs
**Solution:** 
- Check that `firestore:rules` deployed successfully
- Verify user is authenticated
- Check browser console for more details

### Issue: Notion database created but missing fields
**Solution:**
- Check `notionCreateDatabase` function logs
- Verify schema was created in Firestore first
- Test schema selector - make sure selection completes

### Issue: Entry form shows legacy form instead of dynamic form
**Solution:**
- User might not have a schema - they need to reconnect Notion with new flow
- Check `settings.activeSchemaId` in Firestore
- Check browser console for "No active schema" message

### Issue: Existing entries don't show in feed
**Solution:**
- Backward compatibility should handle this
- Check `EntryCard` component error handling
- Legacy entries should still display with their `text`, `photoUrl`, `aiSummary`

---

## Testing Checklist

After deployment, test these scenarios:

### New User Journey
- [ ] New user signs up
- [ ] Goes to Settings ‚Üí Set Up Notion
- [ ] Sees schema selection
- [ ] Selects "Macro Tracking"
- [ ] Completes Notion setup
- [ ] Creates entry with macro fields
- [ ] Entry displays correctly
- [ ] Entry appears in Notion with all fields

### Existing User Journey (If you have test users)
- [ ] Existing user logs in
- [ ] Can still see old entries
- [ ] Old entries display correctly
- [ ] Can create new entries (uses legacy form if no schema)
- [ ] If they reconnect Notion, they get schema selection

### Edge Cases
- [ ] User cancels schema selection (can try again)
- [ ] User selects different templates (all work)
- [ ] No internet connection during schema creation (graceful error)
- [ ] Notion API key invalid (proper error message)
- [ ] Photo upload works in dynamic form
- [ ] Required fields enforced

---

## Performance Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:

1. **Firebase Firestore Metrics:**
   - Read/write operations should be normal
   - New `schemas` collection should have minimal reads
   - Each entry creation: +1 read (schema), +1 write (entry)

2. **Cloud Functions Performance:**
   - `notionCreateDatabase` should complete in < 3 seconds
   - `notionSyncEntry` should complete in < 2 seconds
   - Check for timeout errors (should be rare)

3. **User Experience:**
   - Schema selection loads instantly (static templates)
   - Entry form renders in < 500ms
   - Entry cards load normally

---

## Success Metrics

You'll know deployment is successful when:

‚úÖ No errors in Firebase Console (Functions, Firestore, Hosting)  
‚úÖ New users can select schema templates  
‚úÖ Schemas are created in Firestore  
‚úÖ Notion databases created with custom fields  
‚úÖ Entries sync with all custom fields  
‚úÖ Dynamic fields display in feed  
‚úÖ Existing entries still work  

---

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Monitor for 24-48 hours:**
   - Check logs daily
   - Watch for user reports
   - Monitor Firestore usage

2. **Gather User Feedback:**
   - Do users understand template selection?
   - Are default templates useful?
   - Any confusion points?

3. **Optional Enhancements (Future):**
   - Phase 2: Custom schema editor
   - Phase 5: AI field extraction
   - Migration script for existing users

---

## Support

If you encounter issues during deployment:

1. Check Firebase Console logs
2. Check browser DevTools console
3. Review `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` for architecture details
4. Test in incognito mode to rule out caching issues
