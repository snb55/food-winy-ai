## Planned Enhancements for food.winy.ai

---

## 1. Individual Macro Properties in Notion Database

**Status:** ðŸ“‹ Planned

**Description:**
Currently, all nutritional information is stored in a single "Summary" text field. This feature will add separate database properties for each macronutrient, enabling better filtering, sorting, and data analysis in Notion.

**Implementation:**
- Add individual properties to Notion database:
  - `Protein` (Number) - grams
  - `Carbs` (Number) - grams
  - `Fat` (Number) - grams
  - `Calories` (Number) - kcal
- Parse AI summary to extract macro values
- Update `notionSyncEntry` Cloud Function to populate individual fields
- Update `createFoodLogDatabase` to include these properties in schema

**Benefits:**
- Filter entries by macro ranges (e.g., "Show all high-protein meals")
- Sort by specific nutrients
- Create formulas and rollups in Notion (daily/weekly totals)
- Build charts and visualizations in Notion
- Better data analysis and tracking

**Technical Details:**
```javascript
// Notion database schema update
properties: {
  Name: { title: {} },
  Date: { date: {} },
  Protein: { number: { format: "number" } },
  Carbs: { number: { format: "number" } },
  Fat: { number: { format: "number" } },
  Calories: { number: { format: "number" } },
  Summary: { rich_text: {} },
  Photo: { url: {} }
}
```

- Embed in Notion using `/embed` command
- Real-time data sync from Firebase

### Option B: Notion API Dashboard Page
- Create a dedicated Notion page with database views
- Use Notion API to build custom views:
  - Gallery view for recent meals
  - Table view with macro totals
  - Board view by meal type
  - Timeline view for weekly tracking

### Option C: Notion Database Charts (Recommended)
- Leverage Notion's native database features:
  - Create linked database views
  - Use Notion formulas for calculations
  - Build database charts for visualization
  - Set up filters and sorts

**Features:**
- Daily/Weekly/Monthly macro summaries
- Visual charts and graphs
- Recent entries preview
- Quick stats (total entries, avg calories, etc.)
